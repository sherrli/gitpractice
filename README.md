**gitpractice**
This repository is for learning purposes only.  

We practice working in multiple branches to see the effects of git commands.  


**Shell Syntax**
Constant variables should be in ALL_CAPS.  
Variables whose value can change should be in lower_case.  
\ is used as an escape character.  
``` echo '\n' ```
echos a new line.  

Formatting output can be done with sed, awk, and cut.
``` ls -al | sed -e 's/username//g; s/staff//g' ```
search s/ some phrase and replace with some phrase /g
